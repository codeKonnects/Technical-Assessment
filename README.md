# Technical-Assessment

A REST API Maven application, using Vert.x and Spring, that allows the school to store each student's score at the end of the term.
The school has three terms in a year. The application should also allow teachers to retrieve the result of any student for a specific subject, class and term.
The application should as well allow the school to retrieve all the scores of all subjects of any student, for any selected term, displaying the average score as well.
